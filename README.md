## Political Bias Chrome Extension

Analyze the political bias of the current web page using a Chrome extension and a small Node/Express backend powered by the OpenAI API.

**Disclaimer (accuracy and liability)**: The political bias ratings produced by this project are generated by an AI model based on the text it receives. AI outputs can be inaccurate, incomplete, or reflect systemic and modelâ€‘level biases. The results are provided strictly for informational and experimental purposes and should not be treated as facts, recommendations, or advice.

You are solely responsible for evaluating and verifying any output. The author and contributors make no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, regarding the accuracy, reliability, or suitability of the results and expressly disclaim any and all liability for any loss, harm, or damages arising from use of this software or reliance on its outputs. Use at your own risk.

**Privacy and sensitive sites**: The content script is present on all pages, but it only extracts visible text when you open the extension popup (to enable analysis) and when you click Analyze. No page text is transmitted off your device until you press Analyze; at that point, the text is sent to the local backend (`http://localhost:3000/api/analyze`), which forwards it to OpenAI for processing. Do not analyze pages containing personal, confidential, or regulated information (e.g., banking, email, health/medical records, government portals, internal tools). Use at your own risk.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- An OpenAI API key
- Google Chrome

### Repository Layout
```
bias-chrome-extension/
  chrome-extension/        # Extension source (manifest v3)
  political-bias-backend/  # Node/Express server
```

### 1) Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bias-chrome-extension.git
cd bias-chrome-extension
```

### 2) Set up and run the backend
The backend exposes `POST /api/analyze` on `http://localhost:3000`.

1. Go to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd political-bias-backend
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file containing your OpenAI key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_real_openai_api_key
   ```
3. Install dependencies and start the server:
   ```bash
   npm install
   node server.js
   ```
   You should see: `Server running on http://localhost:3000`.

Optional quick test (from another terminal):
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content":"This is a sample paragraph to analyze."}'
```

### 3) Load the extension in Chrome (Developer Mode)
1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in the top-right).
3. Click "Load unpacked".
4. Select the `chrome-extension` folder inside this repo.
5. The extension should appear in your toolbar. Pin it if needed.

### 4) Use the extension
1. Start the backend (see step 2).
2. Navigate to any web page with text content.
3. Click the extension icon, then click "Analyze Page".
4. You should see a rating and explanation returned by the backend.

### Configuration notes
- The extension is configured to call `http://localhost:3000/api/analyze`. If you deploy the backend elsewhere, update the fetch URLs in:
  - `chrome-extension/background.js`
  - `chrome-extension/popup.js`

### Security
- Do not commit your `.env` file. This repo includes a `.gitignore` that ignores `.env` by default.
- Treat your API key as a secret. Never embed it in extension code.
